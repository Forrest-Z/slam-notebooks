    "#### What is localisation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Localisation means estimating the pose (position and orientation) of a mobile agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to evaluate the quality of a localisation procedure?\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimator can be analyzed if it is unbiased or has low variance.\n",
    "Sometimes konvergencespeed is a criteria too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically answering the following questions:\n",
    "How exact is the estimate?\n",
    "Has it got any systematic errors? (bias)\n",
    "Does it jump around? (variance)\n",
    "Is it consistent?\n",
    "\n",
    "A bonus that most people do not evaluate is:\n",
    "How resistant is the procedure against errors on the input data?\n",
    "Can it correct systematic errors in the input data?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the default approach to localisation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The mobile agent has measurements for a given timestamp and tries to estimate its pose from those. There are several approaches that are partially based on each other: dead reckoning, static localisation, dynamic localisation and SLAM.\n",
